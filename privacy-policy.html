      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>At Leaker.Wiki, your privacy and security are our top priorities. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our anonymous email service. Please read it carefully.</p>

      <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>Leaker.Wiki does not collect personal information about you beyond what is required for providing the service. We do not request personal data such as your full name, address, or date of birth. However, we do log certain data to ensure the stability and security of our services:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>IP Address</strong>: Logged for security and troubleshooting purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Server Logs</strong>: We collect logs related to email traffic (sent/received emails) for performance monitoring.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies</strong>: We use cookies to enhance your user experience, but these cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
      <p>Your email data and activity within the service are primarily used to ensure that you have a smooth experience using Leaker.Wiki. We may use information for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To operate and maintain our email system and its features.</li>
        <li>To troubleshoot and provide technical support in case of issues.</li>
        <li>To monitor the performance and security of the service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Data Retention</h3>
      <p>We retain email data for the shortest time possible to provide our services, while complying with applicable laws and regulations. Emails are deleted from our servers when you delete them, and we do not retain copies unless it is necessary for investigating violations related to abuse or illegal activity, as described below.</p>

      <h3>4. Disclosure of Information</h3>
      <p>We respect your privacy and will not share your personal data with third parties, except in the following cases:</p>

If necessary, we may share information with law enforcement authorities after a thorough review.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Illegal Activities</strong>: If reports related to terrorism, animal cruelty, or violent extremism are reported, we may also share the information with the relevant authorities after an investigation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Security of Your Information</h3>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
